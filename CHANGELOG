Config-Editor GUI Introduction (Major Feature): Implemented a dedicated Graphical User Interface, Config-Editor.py, intended for post-installation configuration management. This UI is designed to bypass the necessity of manual JSON file editing.
Decoupled Configuration Workflow: Introduced a new operational model where ongoing configuration changes are handled by the Config-Editor UI and saved to the user's local config.json. This abstracts the user from the underlying file structure for all changes following initial deployment.

Issue in previous versions was a race condition during system startup-a classic failure of dependency ordering. The service would often start before the necessary user-level desktop session components, like the D-Bus service, were fully initialized. This led to errors and required users to resort to insecure, root-based workarounds. This update resolves that issue permanently by correctly setting the SystemD unit file dependencies (After=dbus. service graphical- session. target ). This ensures the service launches only when the required D-Bus session is active, eliminating the race condition and guaranteeing a stable start.

> Setup Script Overhaul: The setup process has been completely rewritten to improve security and compatibility. hotkey-engineer is now installed as a systemd --user service, which is the modern and secure standard for user-specific applications.
> Wayland Compatibility (via Xwayland): This update ensures the application works reliably on both X11 and Wayland display servers by leveraging the Xwayland compatibility layer. This correctly handles environment variables, allowing the application to function seamlessly without native Wayland support.
> Security Fix: The previous installation method, which ran as a system-wide service, has been removed to mitigate a potential security vulnerability.
> Code Cleanup: Unnecessary code has been removed from the main script for better performance and maintainability.

Cleaned up some code, removed unnecessary code that was there from previous development efforts and releasing the project as beta. and Updated the readme to specify my difficulties with the dedicated language interpreter.

July 30
Move the project to alpha 2 and released alpha to build as a zip folder for new users.

July 30
Updated the config file to be way more consistent. and might have added references?. 

July 28
Updated the setup script it did not automatically launch Hotkey engineers Python correctly, because it's working with virtual environment, so it was a bit more tricky for me. But finally got it patched. Here you go.

Fixed Child Process Logging the child process modules from overloading your computer with log files. Currently, it is set to store up to 10 files of each module. But after doing some testing, it may change.
Cleaned up the setup file from useless information

July 27
Fixed it so it won't immediately eat up a ton of storage by logging. The next logging update for the child process will get released after vigorous testing.
So in its current form, if you run modules, their logs will have to be deleted manually until the next update is released. But its main file, you won't need to worry about.

July 27
Fixed a spelling mistake in the read me. 

July 26
Updated to a readme that was not generated by AI. The AI Readme was a temporary for initial release.

Updated the readme to actually have information.
