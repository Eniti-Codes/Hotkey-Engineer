> Setup Script Overhaul: The setup process has been completely rewritten to improve security and compatibility. hotkey-engineer is now installed as a systemd --user service, which is the modern and secure standard for user-specific applications.
> Wayland Compatibility (via Xwayland): This update ensures the application works reliably on both X11 and Wayland display servers by leveraging the Xwayland compatibility layer. This correctly handles environment variables, allowing the application to function seamlessly without native Wayland support.
> Security Fix: The previous installation method, which ran as a system-wide service, has been removed to mitigate a potential security vulnerability.
> Code Cleanup: Unnecessary code has been removed from the main script for better performance and maintainability.

Fixed Child Process Logging the child process modules from overloading your computer with log files. Currently, it is set to store up to 10 files of each module. But after doing some testing, it may change.
Cleaned up the setup file from useless information

July 27
Fixed it so it won't immediately eat up a ton of storage by logging. The next logging update for the child process will get released after vigorous testing.
So in its current form, if you run modules, their logs will have to be deleted manually until the next update is released. But its main file, you won't need to worry about.
